🚀 Stealth Code Wrapper - Local Dev Guide
HOW TO RUN:
1) npm run dev
2) Click on localhost link in terminal

Hey 👋 This project started for my brother to test locally, but I’m building this to be big. 

This repo powers Real Coder AIer, an AI-powered tool that generates , humanized code using the OpenAI API — with a built-in editor, customization controls, and a quiz-based learning system that forces you to learn from your GPT coding assignments.

I built this to help students complete their assignments, with real humanized code, and learn while doing so.

⚙️ Requirements

Node.js v18+


OpenAI API key (get one here: https://openai.com/index/openai-api/)

🛠️ Setup (Local)

1. Clone the repo

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stealth-code-wrapper.git
cd stealth-code-wrapper

2. Install dependencies

npm install

3. Add your .env

Create a file named .env and paste in:

OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
GITHUB_TOKEN = ghp-your-github-token-here

⚠️ Never share this key. Treat it like a password.

4. Run the backend
npm run dev

Output: Server running on port 3000

5. Launch the frontend

Open public/index.html in your browser.

🔮 Current Features

🧠 AI code generation (OpenAI-powered)

✍️ CodeMirror editor with syntax highlighting

🗂 File tabs for multi-file projects

⚙️ User customization for comments, complexity, naming style

🎮 Learning system

🧠 Troubleshooting

CORS error → make sure frontend + backend are on same port or use proxy

Fetch failed → check server is running on port 3000

OpenAI API error → check your key + usage limit here: OpenAI dashboard

✨ Deployment Tips

Frontend → Javascript w/ Vercel deployment (free, drag-and-drop)

Backend → Render.com (Node.js server)

Or host both with Netlify + custom Express proxy
